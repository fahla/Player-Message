A C++ program where two players, each running in same and separate processes(2 functions), engage in a messaging exchange. One player, termed the "initiator," initiates the communication by sending a message to the second player. Upon receiving a message, a player responds by sending back a new message that concatenates the received message with a message counter-specific to that player. The program is designed to gracefully conclude after the initiator successfully sends and receives 10 messages, establishing a stop condition for program finalization. Pure/standard C++ libs used. Solution is for Linux system, compiled with gcc. Shell script is provided to run the program.
